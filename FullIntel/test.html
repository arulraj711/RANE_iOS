			<span class="ng-binding" ng-bind-html="desc.para | to_trusted">While several analysts have raised their estimates for Apple, some still worry the company depends too much on the iPhone, which contributes two-thirds of its sizable revenue &quot; leaving Apple vulnerable if another gadget comes along to replace the iPhone in popularity. Cook and Chief Financial Officer&nbsp;<span style="background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;">Luca Maestri</span>, however, say they&#39;re optimistic about other products in Apple&#39;s portfolio.

			<span class="ng-binding" ng-bind-html="desc.para | to_trusted">Apple plans to start selling its highly anticipated smartwatch in April, Cook told analysts on a conference call after the company&#39;s earnings report Tuesday. He added that developers are working on new apps called&nbsp;<span style="background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;">&#39;Glances&#39;</span>&nbsp;&quot; apparently in reference to the way people will view those apps on their wrists. Cook boasted he&#39;s already wearing and enjoying an early model. I&#39;m using it every day and love it and can&#39;t live without it, he said. Still, some analysts say it&#39;s difficult to predict demand for the&nbsp;<span style="background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;">Apple Watch</span>. We continue to believe interest from consumers is tepid, said&nbsp;<span style="background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;">Piper Jaffray&#39;s</span>&nbsp;Gene Munster in a recent note to investors.</span></p>

Even so, Maestri said surveys show consumers love iPads for web-browsing and shopping, and he said new apps produced in partnership with&nbsp;<span style="background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;">IBM</span>&nbsp;will increase business uses for the devices. The iPad has a very bright future, Cook added, although he cautioned he doesn&#39;t expect sales trends to change in the next couple of quarters.</span></p>

			<span class="ng-binding" ng-bind-html="desc.para | to_trusted">While Apple is believed to collect fees from banks when shoppers use Apple Pay, it doesn&#39;t specifically disclose revenue from the service. BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis says he doesn&#39;t expect the program will make a &quot;material&quot; contribution to Apple&#39;s revenue in the near future.</span></p>

			<span class="ng-binding" ng-bind-html="desc.para | to_trusted">Apple says iPhone sales doubled in China, Brazil and Singapore in the last quarter, despite aggressive competition from South Korea&#39;s Samsung and the Chinese companies Huawei and Xiaomi. Cook also boasted the company saw record rates of first-time iPhone buyers and former owners of Android phones who are switching to Apple devices, although he didn&#39;t provide specifics.</span></p>
