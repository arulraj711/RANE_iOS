That helped the company report record-smashing earnings for its latest quarter and sent the stock climbing more than 7 percent on Wednesday.</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\">But after selling a record 74.5 million iPhones in three months that ended in December, what can Apple do next?</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\">While several analysts have raised their estimates for Apple, some still worry the company depends too much on the iPhone, which contributes two-thirds of its sizable revenue \" leaving Apple vulnerable if another gadget comes along to replace the iPhone in popularity. Cook and Chief Financial Officer <span style=\"background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;\">Luca Maestri</span>, however, say they're optimistic about other products in Apple's portfolio. Here's some of what they talked about on Tuesday.</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\">Apple plans to start selling its highly anticipated smartwatch in April, Cook told analysts on a conference call after the company's earnings report Tuesday. He added that developers are working on new apps called <span style=\"background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;\">'Glances'</span> \" apparently in reference to the way people will view those apps on their wrists. Cook boasted he's already wearing and enjoying an early model. I'm using it every day and love it and can't live without it, he said. Still, some analysts say it's difficult to predict demand for the <span style=\"background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;\">Apple Watch</span>. We continue to believe interest from consumers is tepid, said <span style=\"background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;\">Piper Jaffray's</span> Gene Munster in a recent note to investors.</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\">Cook boasted he's already wearing and enjoying an early model. \"I'm using it every day and love it and can't live without it,\" he said.</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\">Still, some analysts say it's difficult to predict demand for the Apple Watch. \"We continue to believe interest from consumers is tepid,\" said Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster in a recent note to investors.</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\">Apple introduced its digital payments service last fall, but Cook vowed Tuesday that 2015 will be the year of</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\"><span style=\"background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;\">iPad</span> sales fell 22 percent. Even so, Maestri said surveys show consumers love iPads for web-browsing and shopping, and he said new apps produced in partnership with <span style=\"background: #edf0f0;padding: 0px 3px;margin: 2px;color: #1e8cd4;font-family:Open Sans;\">IBM</span> will increase business uses for the devices. The iPad has a very bright future, Cook added, although he cautioned he doesn't expect sales trends to change in the next couple of quarters.</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\">While Apple is believed to collect fees from banks when shoppers use Apple Pay, it doesn't specifically disclose revenue from the service. BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis says he doesn't expect the program will make a \"material\" contribution to Apple's revenue in the near future.</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\">Apple says iPhone sales doubled in China, Brazil and Singapore in the last quarter, despite aggressive competition from South Korea's Samsung and the Chinese companies Huawei and Xiaomi. Cook also boasted the company saw record rates of first-time iPhone buyers and former owners of Android phones who are switching to Apple devices, although he didn't provide specifics.</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\">Overall, Apple reported $74.6 billion in sales and $18 billion in profit for the December quarter, which represents a year-over-year increase of 30 percent and 38 percent respectively. Based on those numbers, analyst Bill Kreher of the Edward Jones investment firm said he'll be raising his forecasts for the company's performance this year.</span></p><p class=\"infl_art_drill_in\" ng-repeat=\"desc in article_description\"><span class=\"ng-binding\" ng-bind-html=\"desc.para | to_trusted\">Even so, he added, as Apple keeps setting records, \"it's certainly going to be more difficult for them to continue to beat expectations.\"</span></p></body></html>",
